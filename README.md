# Blood-Donation-Assistant-Bot


A basic chatbot made with the ChatGPT's API.

This bot is specifically made to assist users to get information on blood donation in general.
This is a small part of EPICS (Project for community service) project done by my team for University.

Moving forward with this as a base we would be working on the bot performing regression in the background to analyse the (bllood related) inputs given by the users.
